After many years of running, she discovered that Baptiste Power Vinyasa offered her a sweaty, physical asana practice combined with a re-awakening in her mind.  She discovered a strengthened mind body connection that can be applied not only on the mat but in her life.  The more time she spent on her mat, the more shifts she realized off her mat.\nIn her teaching, Lisa encourages and challenges her students, creating opportunities for them to drop the limits that block them from transformation on and off their mats.  Lisa believes that everyone on this earth is powerful and amazing, sometimes the awareness gets hidden in daily life but the Baptiste practice allows you to uncover your power and focus on your strengths.\nWhile not at Anjali Power yoga, or teaching yoga to local school teams, Lisa keeps busy with her husband, 3 children and various pets (currently 4 cats and 2 dogs) or is out training for the racing season.", "city": "Westmont", "state": "NJ", "country": "USA", "studio": "Anjali Power Yoga", "studioUrl": "http://www.anjalipoweryoga.com/"},
  {"id": 2, "firstName": "Nicole", "lastName": "Sargent", "description": "All of my life I had been a planner, but what I have experienced as my life has unfolded, is that often, the most wonderful things along the way were not planned but happened when I relaxed and stopped trying so hard. That’s how I finally saw the love of my life who had been standing in front of me the whole time, and how I left a career in social work to pursue my passion for all things yoga! Power Yoga Canada and Baptiste Yoga came into my life, rocked my world, and showed me ease, freedom and endless possibilities.\nI can still clearly remember my very first experience at a yoga class, I don’t recall what poses we did, or the teacher’s name, but I remember vividly the feeling I was left with afterwards. Sitting in my car, I recall thinking how amazing I felt, not only physically rinsed out, but my busy mind was clear, and I was full of joy, I thought I need more of this! And from that moment on, I had fallen madly & deeply in love with this practice.\nThat was 7 years ago, and since then I haven’t looked back! Since joining the Power Yoga Canada team in 2009, I have kept the flame of my love affair alive by completing Level 1 & Level 2 teacher trainings with Baron Baptiste, as well as the Baptiste Power Flow Immersion in Colorado, and most recently, the Art of Assisting.\nMy Baptiste yoga practice continues to amaze me with its ability to meet me exactly where I am, and to give me exactly what I need in the moment. I love hitting my mat, feeling the physical practice and breath draw me out of my head, into my body, and into a sense of wholeness and complete acceptance. All of my planning and trying in my life and on my mat had left me feeling as though I was banging my head against a brick wall, but my practice gave me the concrete tools of breath and of finding ease in the most uncomfortable situations (and poses!).\n am so grateful and excited to be a part of the Baptiste community as a Certified Teacher, indeed; this is a life that I never could have planned out in my wildest dreams. I can’t wait to see YOU on your mat, and to share my love of this practice and community with you!", "city": "Mississauga", "state": "ON", "country": "Canada", "studio": "Power Yoga Canada", "studioUrl": "http://www.poweryogacanada.com/"},

It was the perfect timing because I was going through a difficult period in my life. I decided to take the 40 days program. Ever since my life has been completely altered in the best kind of way!\nAfter several years of practicing Baptiste Yoga I felt inspired to become and teacher in order to give back. I did my 200 hour teacher training at Yoga One and I have been on fire ever since! After that I completed Levels 1, 2 and 3 with Baron Baptiste in the next year.

I am active with the Africa Yoga Project, being an ambassador and planning to be of service in Kenya for 2 weeks in 2016. I am also collaborating with CrossFit boxes to help bridge the gap between yoga and CrossFit. I began practicing yoga in 1996. I decided to open a yoga studio when I went to Level 1 Baptiste Yoga Bootcamp Aug. 2012. The depth of the practice, holistic approach to health and well-being combined with the powerful transformational process kept me coming back to my mat again and again. Through my own personal transformation and empowerment I realize that it was my purpose and passion to share this powerful practice with as many as people as possible. I opened my studio in 2013. Teaching is a service. I am grateful for every class and I hope that students feel like they’ve been given more than a class. I hope they leave feeling inspired, empowered and also I hope they received an experience they can take off of their mat and into their day to day life.\nI encourage my students to awaken to their personal power, to be on a mission to support others to find peace and happiness in their life and also encourage them to live the life that they want to live, and to be bold enough to live it and make a significant contribution to the world.\nMy Mission is to empower people to realize their purpose, live their best life, and share it with the world.\n“The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be” –Ralph Waldo Emerson", "city": "Minneapolis", "state": "MN", "country": "USA", "studio": "Minnesota Power Yoga", "studioUrl": "http://www.minnesotapoweryoga.com/"},
  {"id": 5, "firstName": "Valerie", "lastName": "Sebestyen", "description": "Valerie Sebestyen is a wedding photographer, fitness guru, an equestrian and all around animal lover reppin’ the good ol’ OKC. When she isn’t on her mat, she’s either frolicking with her dog, or found galloping around with the horses. Spending most of her time editing or photographing weddings, Valerie needed a way to not just exercise but unwind from work. Valerie stumbled into a Baptiste class one day in 2013 and life as she knew it…was over. Valerie left every practice feeling more inspired, empowered, and peaceful. When she went to Level 1- Journey into Power in 2014, she knew she had to share the fire in her heart for the practice and become a teacher. At the end of Level 1, Valerie immediately went to Level 2 - A Sannyasin’s Journey. Upon returning home, Valerie’s parents and friends could see an entire shift in her energy and how she was showing up for them and for herself. Immediately she dove in and set out to start teaching in Gyms, YMCA, yoga studios, various businesses in the community, and a school for Yoga Across America. Valerie has also completed the Power Flow immersion with Baptiste Institute and the Art of Assisting also in 2014.\nLiving a life of authenticity and play, Valerie loves the freedom and integration into GREATNESS that Baptiste Yoga has brought to her life.\nAs an animal lover, Valerie puts her students in touch with the natural world. She invites them to explore their practice in a way that taps into what it means to be a part of the Universe on a greater level than ourselves. With a strong emphasis on natural movement and trying on new expressions and sounds, Valerie describes her classes like “a giant playground for adults.”\nValerie loves how empowering, curious, and positive the Baptiste practice is. It creates a safe space to dance on the edge while expanding deeper peace and space, within. Allowing her fullest self-expression to beam on the mat, Valerie’s intention is to leave each student with the space and comfort to find that for themselves: a grounded sense of Being, and a playful heart.\nValerie currently teaches at Yoga at Tiffany’s OKC www.yogaattiffanys.com and Body Mind Yoga, in Edmond OK www.bmystudios.com.", "city": "Oklahoma City", "state": "OK", "country": "USA", "studio": "Yoga At Tiffany's", "studioUrl": "http://www.yogaattiffanys.com/"},
  {"id": 6, "firstName": "Wendi", "lastName": "Williams", "description": "The thought of becoming a yoga teacher began at the age of 18 when I said “I am going to teach physical education”.  Little did I know that my love of physical activity would manifest itself thirty-two years later as a yoga teacher.\nMy first power vinyasa class hooked me.  I loved the physicality, the sweat and the rinse I felt after class.  I knew I wanted more but at that time I wasn’t exactly sure what that meant.  I went with my instincts and attended Yoga One’s first in-house teacher training.  Before I knew it I was on my way to transformation, attending Baptiste workshops and teacher trainings.\nYoga has enriched my life and it humbles me to see how my yoga practice shows up in my life every day off of my mat.  I have developed and deepened friendships, gained tools to work through uncomfortable situations and found compassion for myself and others.", "city": "Charoltte", "state": "NC", "country": "USA", "studio": "Yoga One", "studioUrl": "http://www.y1now.com/"}
